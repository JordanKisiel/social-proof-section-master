### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the first project where I was able to practice CSS grid areas. I also became more acquainted with how to align items within flexboxes and grids. The mobile-first approach still worked quite well despite this particular layout being more complex which gave me a greater appreciation for the layout tools available in CSS.

### Continued development

Still want to continue practicing and getting more comfortable with CSS grids and their capabilities. Also perhaps move onto and even more complex layout or at least a layout that may require a different approach.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - This video gave me the foundation in CSS grids that I needed to complete this project. The secion on grida areas in particular was very helpful.
